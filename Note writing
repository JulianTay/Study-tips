Note writing is the best kind of studying in my opinion

You can write them however you want, but preferrable you should use one notebook dedicated to one subject, or if the subjects are short, 2 in 1. 
But since we live in a world where technology literally surrounds us, you may also switch to online notes. (e.g. OneNote) 
This form of note writing is not only convenient, but it also saves paper. Less paper = more trees = Reduce Global Warming 

YAy!

The disadvantage to online notes is that you may be less likely to remember the information. This is because typing is less effective as compared to one physically writing the information down. 
As one writes, the information is repeated once through the person's mind. Physical notes thus beat online notes in terms of effectiveness.

Regardless of whether you choose to make physical or online notes, you can always find a way to make both of them work for you.

TYPES OF PHYSICAL NOTES:

1. Notebooks

2. Flashcards

3. Mindmaps

Tips:
